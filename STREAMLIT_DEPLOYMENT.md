### 6. 🚨 Trading Disclaimers

**IMPORTANT RISK WARNINGS:**

- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Trading commodities involves substantial risk of loss
- Only trade with money you can afford to lose
- Always verify signals with your own analysis
- Consider paper trading before live trading

### 7. 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"API Connection Failed"**
   - Check that secrets are configured correctly
   - Verify API keys are active and valid

2. **"No Signals Generated"**
   - This is normal - signals are only generated when conditions are met
   - Try different confidence thresholds
   - Maritime events may not always translate to tradeable signals

3. **"System Loading Slowly"**
   - First load may take longer as APIs initialize
   - Subsequent loads should be faster due to caching
